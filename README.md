### A Real-Time Alert System Using 4G Camera Traps

This software was developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.carpathia.org/">Funda»õia Conservation Carpathia</a>.

<i>**Read the [LICENSE](#-license) and [DISCLAIMER](#-disclaimer) before use.**</i>

## üí° Overview 

This repository contains code to run an wildlife alert system on your laptop, PC or server. You can even run the basic version on a Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB RAM minimum).

The system will process photos sent from a 4G-enabled camera trap and send alerts directly to your mobile phone.

To get started, you will need at lest one 4G-enabled camera trap, a dedicated email address, a Telegram account and some basic python skills.

If you don't have all of these - or you just want to test the system on your device - run the [Example Tutorial](#-example-tutorial).

## üõ†Ô∏è Get Started

### üöÄ Quick Start (Advanced Users)

Get started by following the 11 steps below. If anything doesn't make sense, follow the more detailed [Example Tutorial](#-example-tutorial) below.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the [detection and classification models](#-models).
3. Create the camera traps virtual environment with pip (requirement.txt - recommended) or conda (environment.yaml).
4. Create a dedicated email account to receive the 4G camera trap photos and generate an app password. Your email provider **must** support app passwords (e.g. [Gmail](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)).
5. Set up your 4G camera trap to send photos to this dedicated email address.
6. Create a group in Telegram and note down the [chat ID](https://www.wikihow.com/Know-Chat-ID-on-Telegram-on-Android) (it should start with '#-100').
7. Create a bot in Telegram using @BotFather and note down the bot token ([detailed instructions here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial)). Add the bot to your Telegram group and make it an admin.
8. Update the config.yaml file with your email account settings and Telegram chat ID and bot token.
9. Update the [camera locations](data/camera_locations.csv) CSV file with your camera(s) details, location and a google maps link.
10. Verify that the settings in the the [alert system script](scripts/advanced_alert_system.py) meet your requirements.
11. Activate the virtual environment and run the alert system script: `python3 python3 scripts/advanced_alert_system.py`

The script will check the email account every 60 seconds for unread emails, download any photos, detect and classify animals, and send an alert your Telegram Group. It will then update the [capture database](data/capture_database.csv) and save the original photos in the [photos folder](data/photos). A high level process flow diagramme can be found [here](assets/final_alert_system_flow_diagram.png).

### üéì Example Tutorial

To run the [Example Tutorial Notebook](notebooks/alert_system_tutorial.ipynb), you will need to be able to run [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html#id1).

There are many tutorials on how to do this online. One option is to download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and add the Python and Jupyter extensions.

Once you are set up with Jupyter, you will need to copy the alert system code repository onto your computer. If you know how to use Git, the command is:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ratsakatika/camera-traps.git
   ```

VS Code also provides tools to "clone" (copy) a repository. You can also simply download everything as a zip file by clicking on the green code button at the top of this page.

Now you will need to create a "virtual environment" and install all the modules needed to run the alert system. Open a new terminal (within VS Code or your operating system), navigate to the camera-traps folder (`cd camera-traps`), and create a virtual environment with the required modules using pip (recommended) or conda ([download here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#)):

  - Using pip (Windows):
    ```bash
    python -m venv camera_traps
    camera_traps\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  - Using pip (Linux/macOS):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv camera_traps
    source camera_traps/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  - Using conda (Windows/Linux/macOS):
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate camera_traps
    ```

 You are now ready to open and run the [Example Tutorial Notebook](notebooks/alert_system_tutorial.ipynb).

## ü§ñ Models

<i>**Important:** users must agree to the respective license terms of third-party models.</i>

The **advanced version** of the alert system uses the [MegaDetector](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector?tab=readme-ov-file) object detection model and [DeepFaune](https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr/en/) species classification model:

- MegaDetector Detection Model: [md_v5a.0.0.pt](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/releases/tag/v5.0)
- DeepFaune Classifier Model: [deepfaune-vit_large_patch14_dinov2.lvd142m.pt](https://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/download/deepfaune/v1.1/)

The **basic version** uses DeepFaune's object detection and species classification models:

- DeepFaune Detection Model: [deepfaune-yolov8s_960.pt](https://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/download/deepfaune/v1.1/)
- DeepFaune Classifier Model: [deepfaune-vit_large_patch14_dinov2.lvd142m.pt](https://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/download/deepfaune/v1.1/)

If you are using the alert system in the Carpathian mountains or would like to bias classification performance towards wild boar and bears, you may also wish to try the fine-tuned DeepFaune model. Further details can be found in the accompanying Research Report [COMING SOON].

## üì∑ Data

Some example photos are stored in [data/example_photos](data/example_photos) to get you started.

You could also investigate [LILA BC](https://lila.science/) and [WildLife Insights](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/) if you want to download large camera trap datasets to train your own model, using the notebooks provided in the [archive](archive) folder.
