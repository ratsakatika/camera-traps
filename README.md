# 🐻 AI for Wildlife Monitoring 🐗
### A Real-Time Alert System Using 4G Camera Traps

Tom Ratsakatika | AI and Environment Researcher | University of Cambridge

## 💡 Overview 

This repository contains code to run an wildlife alert system on your personal computer.

The system will process images sent from a 4G-enabled camera trap and send alerts directly to your mobile phone.

To get started, you will need at lest one 4G-enabled camera trap, a dedicated email address, a Telegram account and some basic python skills. However, if you don't have all of these, you can still test out the system using the [Quick Start Tutorial](#-get-started).

## 🚀 Get Started

### Quick Start Tutorial

To run the [Quick Start Tutorial](notebooks/alert_system_tutorial.ipynb), you'll need to be able to run [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html#id1). There are many tutorials on how to do this online. One option is to download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and add the Python and Jupyter extensions.

Once you are set up with Jupyter Notebooks, you will need to copy this code repository onto your computer. If you know how to use Git, the command is:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ratsakatika/camera-traps.git
   cd camera-traps
   ```

VS Code also provides tools to "clone" (copy) a repository. You can also simply download everything as a zip file by clicking on the code button above.
